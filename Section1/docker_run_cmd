What is Image:
	Image is the source file to create a running instance(container) of our environmnet
	It consists for source environment and the startup command which will fire once the container is setup


	Ex: docker run <image name>
	    it will create a running container for this image


  Overriding default command of image:
	if we want to overwrite the startup commands specified in image the we can pass it along with the command
	
	Ex: docker run <image name> <default cmd override>
 
        it a override, so the commands specified inside the image will not execute
	


  Listing all runnning containers:
	
	Ex: docker ps (it gives the list of all running containers)
 
	to get details of all the containers ever created on our machine we use
		Ex: docker ps --all
